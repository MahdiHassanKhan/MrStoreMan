-----------------MrStoreMan-------------------------

Mr. StoreMan is a store management system that has three different interfaces (Owner, Employee, Customer).

Reason for Project Selection: - The main reason to work on this project is to help both store owners & customers. Sometimes shop owners aren’t aware of the income and expenditure of their shop. So, they have to endure loss at the end of the month or year. This app will come in handy for them, thus they can do better in their business. And as store workers can work more precisely using this app it would be more time saving for customers.

Features: -
• Buy and sales track of a shop
• Remaining number of individual items left on the store
• Different module for different group of people (i.e., Admin will login using admin id, store workers/salesman will login using their id etc.)
• Admin/shop owners will have full access over the app
• Store workers/salesman will only be able to operate sales segment
• Depending on owners’, customers may get discount on various occasions
• Monthly and yearly line graph/bar chart of total purchase & sales will be provided
